## Mouse Event Handler Optimization

### Problem
The original `OnMouseEvent` method was performing too many operations, including position checks, debug output, and order sending, causing sluggishness in UI responsiveness.

### Solution
Completely redesigned the `OnMouseEvent` method to be ultra-lightweight:
- Removed all debug output from the event handler
- Eliminated position checks from the event handler
- Removed direct order sending from the event handler
- Implemented a flag-based system where the event handler only sets flags and returns immediately
- Deferred all actual processing to `CalcBar()`

### Implementation
```csharp
protected override void OnMouseEvent(MouseClickArgs arg)
{
    try
    {
        // CRITICAL: Keep this method as lightweight as possible for responsiveness
        
        // Handle F12 key press to cancel orders - minimal processing
        if (arg.keys == Keys.F12)
        {
            // First disable all order flags to immediately stop resubmission
            m_ActiveStopLimitOrder = false;
            m_HasProtectiveStop = false;
            // Then set action flags
            m_CancelOrder = true;
            return;
        }

        // Handle right click - ultra-optimized for maximum responsiveness
        if (arg.buttons == MouseButtons.Right)
        {
            // First disable all order flags to immediately stop resubmission
            m_ActiveStopLimitOrder = false;
            m_HasProtectiveStop = false;
            // Then set action flags
            m_CancelOrder = true;
            m_EmergencyExit = true;
            return;
        }

        // Get the price at the click position and set flags
        m_ClickPrice = arg.point.Price;
        
        // Set appropriate flags based on key modifiers
        if ((arg.keys & Keys.Shift) == Keys.Shift)
        {
            m_IsBuyOrder = true;
            m_OrderCreatedInMouseEvent = true;
        }
        else if ((arg.keys & Keys.Control) == Keys.Control)
        {
            m_IsBuyOrder = false;
            m_OrderCreatedInMouseEvent = true;
        }
    }
    catch (Exception)
    {
        // No logging in exception handler for maximum performance
    }
}
```

## Order Cancellation Optimization

### Problem
Order cancellation was not responsive enough, especially for fast-moving contracts like MNQ. The delay between requesting cancellation and actual cancellation was too long.

### Solution
Implemented a flag-based cancellation system with immediate effect:
- Set cancellation flags in the correct order (disable resubmission flags first)
- Added early cancellation check at the beginning of `CalcBar()`
- Implemented early return after cancellation to skip all other processing

### Implementation
```csharp
// In OnMouseEvent for right-click or F12
m_ActiveStopLimitOrder = false;  // First disable resubmission
m_HasProtectiveStop = false;     // Disable protective stop resubmission
m_CancelOrder = true;            // Then set action flag

// In CalcBar(), at the very beginning
if (m_CancelOrder || m_EmergencyExit)
{
    // Immediately stop all order activity
    m_ActiveStopLimitOrder = false;
    m_HasProtectiveStop = false;
    
    // Process emergency exit if needed
    // ...
    
    m_CancelOrder = false;
    
    // Skip all other order processing this bar
    return;
}
```

## Emergency Exit System

### Problem
In high-volatility situations, traders need an immediate way to exit positions and cancel all pending orders.

### Solution
Implemented a dedicated emergency exit system:
- Added `m_EmergencyExit` flag with highest priority processing
- Right-click now sets this flag instead of trying to send orders directly
- Exit orders are processed at the beginning of `CalcBar()` before any other logic
- Immediately disables all order flags to prevent resubmission

### Implementation
```csharp
// In OnMouseEvent for right-click
m_ActiveStopLimitOrder = false;
m_HasProtectiveStop = false;
m_CancelOrder = true;
m_EmergencyExit = true;

// In CalcBar(), at the very beginning
if (m_CancelOrder || m_EmergencyExit)
{
    // Immediately disable all order flags
    m_ActiveStopLimitOrder = false;
    m_HasProtectiveStop = false;
    
    // Process emergency exit with highest priority
    if (m_EmergencyExit)
    {
        if (StrategyInfo.MarketPosition > 0)
        {
            // Exit long position immediately
            m_ExitLongOrder.Send(OrderQty);
        }
        else if (StrategyInfo.MarketPosition < 0)
        {
            // Exit short position immediately
            m_ExitShortOrder.Send(OrderQty);
        }
        
        m_EmergencyExit = false;
    }
    
    // Skip all other processing
    return;
}
```

## Debug Output Optimization

### Problem
Excessive debug output was causing performance degradation, especially in time-critical paths.

### Solution
- Completely removed all debug output for maximum performance
- Replaced with minimal comments to maintain code readability
- Maintained the `m_Debug` flag for potential future debugging needs

### Implementation
```csharp
// Before
if (m_Debug) Output.WriteLine("Resubmitting BUY order at " + m_StopPrice);

// After
// Resubmit logging removed for performance
```

## Order Resubmission Optimization

### Problem
Order resubmission logic was not optimized and could potentially interfere with cancellation.

### Solution
- Simplified the order resubmission logic
- Removed unnecessary nested blocks
- Added explicit checks to prevent protective stop management during cancellation
- Optimized flag checking to minimize unnecessary processing

### Implementation
```csharp
// If we have an active stop limit order, keep submitting it until filled or canceled
if (m_ActiveStopLimitOrder)
{
    // Submit the appropriate order based on the buy/sell flag
    if (m_IsBuyOrder)
    {
        m_StopLimitBuy.Send(m_StopPrice, m_LimitPrice, OrderQty);
    }
    else
    {
        m_StopLimitSell.Send(m_StopPrice, m_LimitPrice, OrderQty);
    }
}

// Only manage protective stops if we haven't canceled orders
if (!m_CancelOrder && !m_EmergencyExit)
{
    ManageProtectiveStops();
}
```

## Protective Stop Management

### Problem
Protective stop management could interfere with order cancellation and emergency exits.

### Solution
- Added early return in `ManageProtectiveStops()` if cancellation is in progress
- Only calls `ManageProtectiveStops()` if no cancellation is in progress
- Optimized flag checking to minimize unnecessary processing

### Implementation
```csharp
private void ManageProtectiveStops()
{
    try
    {
        // Quick early return if cancellation is in progress
        if (m_CancelOrder || m_EmergencyExit)
        {
            return;
        }
        
        // Rest of protective stop management logic
        // ...
    }
    catch (Exception)
    {
        // Error logging removed for performance
    }
}
```

## Smart Order Adjustment

### Problem
Adjusting existing orders required canceling and creating new orders, which was inefficient.

### Solution
Enhanced the mouse event handling to make Shift and Ctrl clicks smart enough to detect and adjust existing orders:
- Added `isAdjustingExistingOrder` flag to detect when clicking with the same modifier key as an existing active order
- Reused the same code path for both new orders and adjustments
- Leveraged the continuous resubmission pattern to adjust orders without explicit cancellation

### Implementation
```csharp
// Handle Shift+Click for Buy orders
if ((arg.keys & Keys.Shift) == Keys.Shift)
{
    // Smart order handling - check if we already have an active buy order
    bool isAdjustingExistingOrder = m_ActiveStopLimitOrder && m_IsBuyOrder;
    
    // Set flags for buy order
    m_IsBuyOrder = true;
    m_IsExitOrder = false;
    m_OrderCreatedInMouseEvent = true;
    
    // The same code path works for both new orders and adjustments
}
```

## MultiCharts .NET Attributes

### Optimization
Added appropriate attributes to the strategy class to optimize order handling:

```csharp
[MouseEvents(true), IOGMode(IOGMode.Enabled), RecoverDrawings(false)]
[SameAsSymbol(true)]
[AllowSendOrdersAlways]
public class clicktrader : SignalObject
```

- `[MouseEvents(true)]`: Enables mouse event handling
- `[IOGMode(IOGMode.Enabled)]`: Enables intra-bar order generation for more responsive order handling
- `[AllowSendOrdersAlways]`: Allows sending orders at any time, not just during calculation
- `[SameAsSymbol(true)]`: Ensures the strategy uses the same symbol as the chart
- `[RecoverDrawings(false)]`: Disables drawing recovery for better performance

## Conclusion

These optimizations have significantly improved the responsiveness of the ClickTrader strategy, particularly for fast-moving contracts like MNQ. The key principles applied were:

1. **Keep mouse event handlers ultra-lightweight**
2. **Process cancellations and emergency exits with highest priority**
3. **Use flag-based order management instead of direct cancellation**
4. **Eliminate all debug output from time-critical paths**
5. **Optimize order resubmission logic**
6. **Implement smart order adjustment**

These optimizations follow the MultiCharts .NET Programming Guide best practices and should provide a much more responsive trading experience.
